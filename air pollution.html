        	<h2>Air Pollution</h2>
        	<img src="air.jpg"/>
        	<p>Air is composed of ~78% nitrogen, ~21% oxygen, ~0.9% argon. The remaining elements include carbon dioxide, water vapour, hydrogen, and other trace elements. Although gases like carbon dioxide and methane may only exist in small absolute concentrations, their outsized heat-trapping potential as greenhouse gases makes them the major factor in accelerating climate change. Air pollution occurs when there is an alteration to the composition of air, either by volume, or in the chemical, physical, or biological properties. The atmosphere is a delicate balance of elements and particles. Any imbalance, even in small proportions can be detrimental to living organisms including animals and crops.</p>
