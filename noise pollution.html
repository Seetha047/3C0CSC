        	<p>Noise pollution, also known as environmental noise or sound pollution, is the propagation of noise with ranging impacts on the activity of human or animal life, most of them harmful to a degree. The source of outdoor noise worldwide is mainly caused by machines, transport, and propagation systems.Poor urban planning may give rise to noise disintegration or pollution, side-by-side industrial and residential buildings can result in noise pollution in the residential areas. Some of the main sources of noise in residential areas include loud music, transportation (traffic, rail, airplanes, etc.), lawn care maintenance, construction, electrical generators, wind turbines, explosions, and people.

Documented problems associated with noise in urban environments go back as far as ancient Rome. Today, the average noise level of 98 decibels (dB) exceeds the WHO value of 50 dB allowed for residential areas.Research suggests that noise pollution in the United States is the highest in low-income and racial minority neighborhoods,and noise pollution associated with household electricity generators is an emerging environmental degradation in many developing nations.</p>
